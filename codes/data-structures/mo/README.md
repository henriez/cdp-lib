# Mo's Algorithm
A technique for solving offline range queries on static arrays by sorting queries to minimize total pointer movement. It processes intervals by incrementally updating the range  via `add` and `remove` operations. With the optimal block size, the time complexity is $\mathcal{O}((N+Q)\sqrt{N})$ or $\mathcal{O}(N\sqrt{Q})$, depending on block size choice ($\sqrt{N}$ or $N/\sqrt{Q}$).
This example solves queries for distinct elements in range
